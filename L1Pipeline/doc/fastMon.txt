Subject: FastMon on the pipeline

Hi,
we made some modifications on the Fast Mon code to make it run from a shell script.
Now you can run from any directory you want, provided that you set two environmental variables:
FAST_MON_DIR : points to the directory that contains the code and it's used to write the iterators classes
XML_CONFIG_DIR : points to the directory of the default xml configuration files

It works on lat-hobbit3, with the right environment (i.e. sourcing /afs/slac/u/gl/carmelo/FastMonTest/isoc.cshrc).
An example of shell script is in /afs/slac/u/gl/carmelo/FastMonTest/runFastMon.sh

I have no idea about what is needed to run it on the pipeline, can you try and tell us if it works (I don't think so) or
where it crashes?

Ciao
Carmelo



we are implementing the agreed modifications the the FastMon. The first important one is how to run it: as required by
Warren, you MUST now explicitly write the output ntuple file path (using the -o option) and the histograms file path (using
the -p option). The -d option no longer exists.
Here is an example, if you run the command:

./pDataProcessor.py -c ../xml/config.xml -o /data/outfiles/test.root -p /data/outfiles/histograms.root
/data/evtfiles/test.evt

you will run it on the input file: "/data/evtfiles/test.evt"
and you will create the ntuple output file: "/data/outfiles/test.root"
and the histograms output file: "/data/outfiles/histograms.root"
the error file will be: "/data/outfiles/test.error.pickle" (this will change, do you want to explicitly set the name?)

Important notices:
- the two root files must be different! (pDataProcessor will exit otherwise)
- the last version includes the correct absolute timestamp calculation.
