Subject: FastMon on the pipeline

Hi,
we made some modifications on the Fast Mon code to make it run from a shell script.
Now you can run from any directory you want, provided that you set two environmental variables:
FAST_MON_DIR : points to the directory that contains the code and it's used to write the iterators classes
XML_CONFIG_DIR : points to the directory of the default xml configuration files

It works on lat-hobbit3, with the right environment (i.e. sourcing /afs/slac/u/gl/carmelo/FastMonTest/isoc.cshrc).
An example of shell script is in /afs/slac/u/gl/carmelo/FastMonTest/runFastMon.sh

I have no idea about what is needed to run it on the pipeline, can you try and tell us if it works (I don't think so) or
where it crashes?

Ciao
Carmelo
