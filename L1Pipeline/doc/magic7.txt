To roll your own, the idiom is:

python ${taskBase}/scripts/DiagRet.py --scid $scid -b "$t0" -e "$t1" --lsm | grep -E 'ATT|ORB' > magic7.txt

Where 

 taskBase=/afs/slac/g/glast/isoc/flightOps/offline/halfPipe/prod
 scid=77
 t0/t1 are ISO-8660 UTC time strings of the form "YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS"

This has to be run in a PROD ISOC environment, like FASTCopy.py.

(20:07:14) bryson: Each ISOC environment has its own raw-packet archive location, and the incoming deliveries from the MOC populate ISOC_FLIGHT, but not _TEST or _NIGHTLY.  However, you can always point utilities like DiagRet.py to a specific raw-archive with the --arch argument.  

Use --arch /nfs/farm/g/glast/u23/ISOC-flight/Archive/level0 to retrieve real observatory data.
