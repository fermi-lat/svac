I have a script, launchFlagFT2.sh, which taks as arguments the 
pipeline mode and the run id. We need to figure out where I should put a link so 
you can always find it in the same place. Should probably have different links 
for prod and dev. So it'd be something like

/some/disk/somewhere/PROD/launchFlagFT2.sh PROD 321819587


/nfs/slac/g/glast/ground/datamonitoring/badtimeintervals/DEV/launchFlagFT2.sh
/nfs/slac/g/glast/ground/datamonitoring/badtimeintervals/PROD/launchFlagFT2.sh
