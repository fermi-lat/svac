-----------------
Stage crumbs (but not chunks) on xroot.


1.76
-----------------
Retry failed DB connections.
genericScript.py catches exceptions in the main function and does cleanup.
Convert findChunks to use genericScript.py, with a cleanup routine that
removes the throttle and run lock if status != 0, so it's safe to autoretry.
Enable autoretry on findChunks.
Invoke locking preexec script with 'python script' instead of 'script' with a
shebang. Hopefully this will stop the "bad interpreter" error messages.

Allow attaching extra metadata when registering files - use to specify cut for filtered merit.
fileNames.fileName can get file name from a variable, if so it overrides the normal rules.
Allow execing scripts instead of including them in the XML. Shouldn't use this for prod.
Add P100-FT2 task.
Start work on genericScript to reduce boilerplate [not yet].

Include delivery ID in messages logging alarms.
Reserve (not just require) scratch space.
Don't retry cleanupCrumbs.
Don't retire runs that have merging trouble.
Run 2 different versions of verify (for InProgress and Complete runs).

1.52
-----------------
Keep & register ft2Txt files.
Keep (but don't register) fakeFT2 files.
Support dataset versions in data catalog. LONE-58
Update run quality table. LONE-60

All of the xxx.version files are gone.  You still have to say next=True when
asking for the name of a file you're about to create.  And you have to add a
variable to processes in the XML for any run-level file they read or create.

Anything that used to depend on a run-level file being created now depends on
it's being registered.  This reduces the number of things that checkRun has to
depend on, and lowers branching numbers elswhere, so it should make the graph
less heinous-looking. (But that's not why I did it.)

registerPrep/registerStuff can now handle multiple fileTypes from the same
parentProcess, so preRegiter is no longer necessary (and won't work anymore,
anyway).  Just run registerPrep.prep once for each file you create, then have
a registerXxx step for each, all depending on the creating process.

Everything that used to be named Eor is now named Hist.  This is not just a
cosmetic change.

fakeFT2.

Run most things on long, digi & recon on medium.
Don't specifiy 32-bit hosts.
Set MALLOC_CHECK_=0.

TestReport TRdp20070706
EngineeringModelRoot v3r0p3
pipelineDatasets v0r3

Fix fastMon.py.  FastMon fails to produce output if the number of events is
not restricted.  Set limit to 50K.

Attempting to use this for ETE2.
-------------------------------------------


1.7
-----------------
Add ingestion of trending outputs.
Use checkRun batch job (not script).
Get merge configs for EOR, TDMon, FastMon.
Generate histograms (not just trees) in FastMon, and register them.
-------------------------------------------

-----------------
Expand registration script at install time instead of hardcoding it
repeatedly, and set dataset type correctly.
Add checkChunk process.
Put updateRunStatus and cleanupChunks in a subtask.
Lock run directory in before findChunks, unlock in checkRun.
Add FastMon.
Add digi and recon end-of-run monitoring.
Add digi and recon trending.
Work on ASP launch code.
-------------------------------------------


1.5
-----------------
Uses test version of pipelieDatasets that uses CloneTree to merge - fast, but 
untrusted.
export FT1 working.
-------------------------------------------


1.4 2007/04/05
-----------------
EM v7r0913p11
TestReport v3r6p41

Add exportL1 process (doesn't actually do the export yet)
Do a cmt config when building packages at install time
Use run, chunk, crumb IDs as stream #s
When merging:
  If no input files, print a message and die.
  Stage output file, and any input files that don't fit on /scratch, on AFS.
    Except we can't write to AFS.  So the code to do this is commented out.
