As i mentioned, when you have to run this thing many times it might be convenient to specify things on the command line,
and having a joboptions file that has the minimum info (which is always the same for all runs); which is the monconfig file.


I attached the joboptions file i am using, and below you find the command i use to run the show for the digi files.


runStrip_t.exe -b 10 -j /nfs/farm/g/glast/u33/dpaneque/DataMonitoring/
MartinCode/VersionCVS_2007_06_28/svac/Monitor/mk062007/src/jobOptions_batch_test.xml -d /nfs/farm/g/glast/u33/dpaneque/
DataMonitoring/Data/LinksToDigiFiles_From_2006_11_01_To_2006_11_14/digitization-licos-v3r8p2_077012902_digi_DIGI.root -o
/nfs/farm/g/glast/u33/dpaneque/DataMonitoring/Results/OutBatch/Test3/newtest/Trending_Run_077012902 -g
/nfs/farm/g/glast/u33/dpaneque/DataMonitoring/Results/OutBatch/Test3/html/Trending_Run_077012902.html

Here you have
 -b   timebin
-j   joboptions file
-d  digi file
-o output root file (complete name will be created by the code)
-g output html file (complete name will be created by the code)

If you want to run on recon, then you also need to specify the recon run as -r reconfile.root.

If you specify everything on the command line anyway then you don't need the -j option. Instead do -c <monconfigfile.xml>.
The directory for the shared libraries is specified with -w <directory>.
It can be done this way if that's preferred to a job options file.
