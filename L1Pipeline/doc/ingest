The following are the scripts to invoke: turns out they are shell scripts. Hope this is ok:

 

/afs/slac.stanford.edu/g/glast/ground/bin/ingestRecoTrending

/afs/slac.stanford.edu/g/glast/ground/bin/ingestDigiTrending

 

 
It should take three arguments:

1- The file to ingest
2- The version (not sure if you are using it)
3- The database: prod/dev

- version  So far we have used "v0"
- database  prod/dev
