For digi/recon analysis, command will look like
${CALIBTKRUTILROOT}/rh9_gcc32/tkrRootAnalysis.exe [digi root file] [recon root file] [output root file]


For processing of resulting root file,
unsetenv PYTHONPATH
unsetenv ROOTSYS
source ${CALIBTKRUTILROOT}/cmt/setup.csh
${CALIBTKRUTILROOT}/python/tkrMonitor.py [input root file] [output root file] [html directory] [alert file] [log file]

Before the software freeze, these are stuff we would like to work on.

1. alert xml file (I need to know the format).
2. parameter limit xml file (I am using a text file in calibTkrUtil now. I plan to change to use a file in
${LATMonRoot}/TKR. I am wondering if I should share limits with David for "error" condition. (We also have different level
of alerts such as "info", "notice" and "warning". I think we can use our own limits for these less important alerts, but it
might be a good idea to share the same "error" limit to avoid having different limits between us and David.
3. Improve html report.
4. Reference root file in ${LATMonRoot}/TKR. (There are some parameters that requires references for better understandings
of performance.)
