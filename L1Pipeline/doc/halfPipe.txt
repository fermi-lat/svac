The stopper is whether or not the files

/afs/slac/g/glast/isoc/flightOps/offline/halfPipe/prod/config/haltL1

And

/afs/slac/g/glast/isoc/flightOps/offline/halfPipe/prod/config/haltOnline

Exist.

Should be safe to roll back anything you need.

In v6r1p0, I added a per-downlink "pin" for launchL1....  just touch the file
/nfs/farm/g/glast/u42/ISOC-flight/Downlinks/$DOWNLINK_ID/haltL1 
and it'll skip the L1Proc createstream (but still generate and deliver all the
.txt files, etc.).
