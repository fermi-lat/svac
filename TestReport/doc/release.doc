v0

First version of test report generator.

To be done: get info from on line configuration file

v1

Change codes to use Doxygen to produce report in both html and latex format

v2

add code to get info from recon root file

v2r1

add codes to read the TestReport version and EngineeringModel version from
job option file and display them in the report.

v3

add codes to produce recon report

v3r1

add many more tweaks to the reports

v3r1p0

add no. of bad events shown in EventSummaryData

v3r2

add a plot to check consistence between CAL recon and TKR recon

v3r2p0

Cosmetic changes

v3r2p1

Add time interval plot from GEM. Change trigger bit calculated by triggerAlg

v3r2p1

Use lastController0Strip in digi root file to deduce the splitting info in TKR
Roll back trigger bit definition calculated by triggerAlg

v3r2p4

Remove codes which print statement on whether calibration constants were used
in reconstruction. From now on, reconstruction must use constants

v3r2p5

Trigger bit definition produced by triggerAlg is now same as the GEM bit definition.

v3r2p6

Add a row in both GLT and GEM trigger table to present no. of events triggered 
by a particular trigger.

v3r2p7

The title of the Gem delta event time histogram says: "Time interval between adjacent event in millsecond with a cut of 1 ms." It should be: "Time interval between adjacent events in milliseconds." There is no cut of 1 ms.Jira-SVAC-14
