v3r1

add many more tweaks to the reports

v3r1p0

add no. of bad events shown in EventSummaryData

v3r2

add a plot to check consistence between CAL recon and TKR recon

v3r2p0

Cosmetic changes

v3r2p1

Add time interval plot from GEM. Change trigger bit calculated by triggerAlg

v3r2p1

Use lastController0Strip in digi root file to deduce the splitting info in TKR
Roll back trigger bit definition calculated by triggerAlg

v3r2p4

in reconstruction. From now on, reconstruction must use constants

v3r2p5

Trigger bit definition produced by triggerAlg is now same as the GEM bit definition.
