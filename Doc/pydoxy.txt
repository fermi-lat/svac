Tips, tricks, caveats and gotchas for pythfilter.py.

Getting good results:
---------------------

Files must have \file and \brief comments.

Function and class definitions must be preceded by non-doxyfilter comments.

There must be a non-doxyfilter comment between file comment block and module
docstring.

Function, class, and method doc strings must immediately succeed the defining
statement, without blank lines between.

How to document instance attributes?

Prefer "@" over "\" for doxygen commands, especially in docstrings, as "\" hsa
special meaning in Python strings.

Mainpage and file markup go in comments, module, class, and function markup
goes in doc strings.


Other recommendations:
----------------------

 File-related markup should be fairly minimal.
