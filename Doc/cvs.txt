Xin and I both felt that CVS should be sufficient for our present needs, and
that it would be best not to depend on additional packages such as CMT.

Setting up CVS for local access is not challenging.  We just need disk space
to which we can all write, on which to store the repository.  The manual
suggests that disk usage will be about 3 times the size of the source code,
this should be trivial compared to the amount of data that we have to store.

The repository presumably should reside in some GLAST disk area.  Moving it to
a different location after it is set up is trivial from an administration
viewpoint, but does involve a small amount of trouble for users.  It should be
in a location that is backed up regularly by SCS.  Xin has requested a 500MB
partition for this purpose from SCS, and is working with Richard DuBois to set
up the repository.

Setting up server access to allow development from offsite machines is more
involved, I don't feel a need to do so at this time.  One reason to do so
would be to allow working from a home machine without staying connected
tduring the entire editing session.

After talking to SAS, we decide to use SAS's CVS repository. We will create a top
dir SVAC, then every package checked in by us has to be stored in the SVAC dir.

HTML and Latex files generated by Doxgen should not be in the CVS. Thanks to the SAS group,
we can use their space to store html files so that they become web accessible. The place is
