\section{Introduction}
\label{intro-sec}

This is obviously very preliminary, I mostly just wanted to get the graphs
out.


\section{Logical Flow}
\label{logic-sec}

Figure \ref{desired-fig} depicts dependency flow in the I\&T pipeline task set.
This is an idelaized version of what we'd like, the actual mapping of this
structures onto the capabilities of the current GINO implementation will be
discussed in Section \ref{implement-sec}.

\begin{figure}

{TPs are in boxes. Shaded boxes are reprocessing entry points.  Datasets are
ellipses. Non-file dependencies are triangles.  Solid lines show input/output
relationships of TPs and DSs.}

\end{figure}

There are 15 task processes (TPs), 8 of which are entry points.  11 Datasets
and 1 non-file dependency (creation of a database record for the run) are
shown.  Several datasets internal to a single TP are not shown here.




\section{Implementation}
\label{implement-sec}

Figure \ref{actual-fig} shows how we mapped the logical dependency flow onto
the capabilities of GINO.

\begin{figure}
\label{actual-fig}
\caption{Actual}

\includegraphics[bb=120 38 545 502,width=7.5in,height=6.5in]{actual-EM2-v1r0.eps}

{Each entry point represents a task.  Hexagons show symbolic links. Dashed
lines show the sequence of TPs within a task.  Dotted lines show launching of
tasks by TPs and creation of symbolic links, both of which happen witho GINO's
knowledge.  TPs and datasets are labeled taskName:tpName and taskName:dsName
(version numbers removed from taskName) so they can be identified with the
matching entities in the GINO configration.}

\end{figure}

There are more TPs (22 here), since it takes a TP to launch a task.  Under a
future version of GINO which understood parallel execution, branching
dependency flow, and multiple entry points, all of this stuff would be in 2
tasks (instead of 8 now), and all but 1 of these "chaining" TPs would be
eliminated.  

Note that each TP involves at least two scripts.  Setting this up required
filling out over 400 fields trough a web interface.  They had to be entered
without error, as they could not be edited once entered.  That web interface
is now deprecated, configuration is done with XML files which can be edited
offline or machine-generated.

There appear to be more datasets.  This is beacuse the DSs seen by a task
include the task name, so the TPs that launch a task must make copies of or
links to DSs that are passed on to the next task.  Thus, digi\_digi\_root is a
real file, while recon\_digi\_root, digiReport\_digi\_root, svac\_digi\_root,
and reconReport\_digi\_root are all links to the same data which must appear
with all those names to work with GINO's naming convention.

There are more edges.  These represent extra information that must be
maintained by the user, as the ordering of TPs within a task must be
explicitly specified to GINO, and launching of other tasks by TPs and
launching of tasks are done ``by hand,'' without GINO's knowledge.

The dependency on the eLog DB is not explicitly present - it is guaranteed by
the ordering of the tasks.

I have in mind an alternate (harder, of course) approach to launching tasks
that would reduce latency waiting for tasks to run and simplify this graph
somewhat.  This is shown in Figure \ref{newlaunch-fig}.
