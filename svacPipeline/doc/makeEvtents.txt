If everything downstream (all the SVAC tasks) are ready, then deleting the file 

/nfs/farm/g/glast/u23/ISOC/glastops/dispatch/077005158 

will make the dispatcher "forget" that it has already seen that run, and re-dispatch it.  Since the event data has now
showed up in the archive, the RetDef.xml and .pkt files will get created, and the run will be dispatched to
CHS-eventFile-v1r0p1.

The dispatch-history directory is mode 2775 to group 'gl', so either of you should be able to delete the run-marker file and
trigger the re-dispatch.

There should be a eventRet.sh there that is a link to the current version.
